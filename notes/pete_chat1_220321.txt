Pete - Final project - 22.03.21

- Shared idea about Golpo website
- Thinks it is a good one
- Order/food cart: should be possible with what we know already
- Payment:
	- can have multiple options
	- cash on delivery, online transfer, paypal
	- paypal developer api available for dummy transactions
	- not sure about actual payments
	- could find tutorials online
	- good feature to practice!
- Language:
	- resource used by Spiced: www.i18next.com/
	- Ivana might know more
	- Might be overkill to use this
	- Could think double language components
	- Depends on amount of text to translate...
- React
	- choice of framework
	- fresh in mind
	- most time spent
	- OK
- Redux
	- depends on content of project
	- at the moment is not necessary to include (current plan)
	- for future versions might be interesting
- PDF generation: link to npm package www.npmjs.com/package/pdfkit
